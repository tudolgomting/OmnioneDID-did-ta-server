/**
 * TypeAdapter for ServerTokenPurpose enum.
 *
 * This adapter is necessary to correctly serialize and deserialize enums that use custom values,
 * such as integers or other non-standard representations, in JSON. By default, Gson serializes enums
 * using their name, but in some cases, an enum might be represented by a specific value (e.g., an integer)
 * in JSON. This adapter ensures that the correct value is written to and read from JSON, allowing
 * for proper handling of these enums in API requests and responses.
